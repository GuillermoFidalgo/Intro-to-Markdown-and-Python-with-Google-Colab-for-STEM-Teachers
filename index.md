# Welcome to the Software Carpentry for K-12 Teachers

This is intended for people (mainly teachers) who are not familiar with programming at any level.
The hope is that through this workshop we are able to enable STEM teachers with basic knowledge on Google Colab and Python such that they can further develop and complement their class with programming in any way.


## What you need to know

Python is a high level language, that is, it is easy for the reader to understand its syntax.

**Go to the setup to learn how to get started!**

> ## Prerequisites
> - A Gmail account. And sometimes not even that!
